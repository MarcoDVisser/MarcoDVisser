I am an Assistant Professor in the [Institute of Environmental Sciences](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/environmental-sciences) at [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en). I am broadly interested in forests and the role they play in the earth system. My research interests include community, population, and biophysical modeling. More specifically, I aim to merge big data wuth big theory, applying physical models as well as physics-aware machine learning to study the health and future of worlds tropical forests. I am a proponent of open and reproducible science, which is why I publish most of my code here, and develop open-source R-packages for high profile computing [aprof](https://github.com/MarcoDVisser/aprof), autotomated tracking and computer vision [trackdem](https://github.com/MarcoDVisser/trackdem) and radiative transfer modelling [ccrtm](https://github.com/MarcoDVisser/ccrtm). A full overview of developed software can be found here.
